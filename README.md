## üìù About
<p>This project was developed based on the layout of the old Airbnb website. The aim was to recreate the look and feel of the original design while ensuring that the page is fully responsive and follows semantic HTML principles.</p>
<p>Throughout the project, I made use of React's component-based architecture to build reusable and modular UI components. This approach allowed me to efficiently manage and organize the different parts of the application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.</p>
<p>Through this project, I had the opportunity to explore and experiment with the best practices and latest technologies in the industry. Some of the key technologies and tools I incorporated into this project include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Material UI</li>
  <li>React Hooks</li>
  <li>React Router</li>
  <li>Vercel Hosting</li>
  <li>Flexbox</li>
  <li>Date Picker</li>
  <li>Responsive</li>
</ul>

## üõçÔ∏è Future Features

This web application was designed for future API consumption receiving inputs from the date-range-picker component. In the future I would like to implement the search system, the react-query library, CSS modules and some animation techniques to make the app nicer and smoother.
